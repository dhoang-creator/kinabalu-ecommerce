## Introduction

The above System Design Architecture Diagram demonstrates the workflow of data from the Frontend/Web UI and the different services that encompass the microservices architecture with their respective DB clusters & third party tools i.e. Elastic Search Cluster, Kafka & Spark.

Note: Before making the repo public, we need to break down the elements of the above diagram and use a System Design Template creator to clear up the interconnectedness of the services and even bring in Cloud Computing Services (just to gain an understanding of how a local microservice architecture would interact with services such as AWS S3, EC2, Lambda etc) => all of this needs to be done before we continue with assessing the overall presumed functionality and programming.

The above diagram is just a continuation of the first image wherein you search for items and place them in your cart.

The above is a breakdown of the Purchase Checkout and this fits into the wider system design diagram demonstrated above
